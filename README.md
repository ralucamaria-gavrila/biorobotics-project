# Biorobotics Project: Xylophone-Playing Robotic Arm

This repository contains the source code for a project developed as part of the **Biorobotics minor** at the **University of Twente**. The minor is offered during the first quartile.

## Project Overview
The project involves designing and implementing a **robotic arm that plays the xylophone**. It serves as a prototype aimed at assisting individuals with **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**, a condition that progressively weakens muscles, eventually limiting limb movement.

## Team & Collaboration
This project was completed by a multidisciplinary team of students with backgrounds in:
- **Computer Science**
- **Biomedical Engineering**
- **Industrial Design**

## Demo
